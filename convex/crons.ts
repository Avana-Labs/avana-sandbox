/**
 * Scheduled jobs.
 *   - refresh token prices from DefiLlama every 10 minutes so the sandbox "Price" tracks
 *     production and staleness surfaces within ~20m of a wedged cron (the batched request is cheap).
 *   - roll up daily market stats near end-of-day UTC: flush the running liquidity
 *     delta into a persistent `marketDailyStats` snapshot so the chart series grows
 *     over calendar time with real activity (seed = starting history only).
 *   - liquidity aggregate rebuild + compaction are ACTION-TRIGGERED (see `convex/liquidity.ts`),
 *     not interval crons — idle hours must not burn scheduled executions.
