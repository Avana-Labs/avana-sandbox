/**
 * Server-authoritative rewards catalog. Mirrors the id → reward-amount slice of
 * `app/lib/rewards-engine/catalog.ts`; the client owns the presentation catalog
 * (titles, descriptions, requirement logic) but the SERVER is the sole source of
 * truth for how many AVA a claimed task pays out. Any drift the client sends via
 * `recordRewardsClaim` is discarded — the mutation looks up each task here and
 * recomputes the amount, so a forged inflated `amountUsd` cannot be persisted.
 *
 * When adding a new quest to `app/lib/rewards-engine/catalog.ts`, add its id and
 * `rewardAmount` here in the same PR. The convex-test on `recordRewardsClaim`
 * verifies this table can't be bypassed, but it cannot warn about missing entries.
 *
 * The sandbox AVA "price" is $1 (1 AVA = $1 USD), matching the client's implicit
 * 1:1 convention in `calculateRewardSummary` where `totalClaimableAmount` (AVA)
 * is displayed and persisted as `claimUsd`.
