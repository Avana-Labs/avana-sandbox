 * `${domain}/.well-known/openid-configuration` → JWKS to verify each token.
 *
 * `domain` MUST equal the token `iss` (app/lib/siwe/jwt.ts resolveIssuer) and be
 * reachable by the Convex backend. Local dev defaults to the Next dev origin; set the
 * `SIWE_JWT_ISSUER` Convex env var in deployed environments (e.g. the Vercel URL).
