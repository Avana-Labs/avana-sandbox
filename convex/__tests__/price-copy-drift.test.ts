/**
 * Convex functions can't import app/ modules, so the server-side price fallbacks are hand-copied
 * from the app's PRICE_FIXTURE. Those copies have drifted before (weth was 1934 in onboarding vs
 * 2240 in umbrella). This test turns "keep in sync by hand" into an enforced invariant: any copy
 * that diverges from the single fixture fails CI. (The live oracle is preferred at runtime; these
 * are only the cold-cache fallback, so they must at least agree with the deterministic seed.)
