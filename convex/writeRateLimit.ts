/**
 * Per-identity write throttle for sandbox mutations.
 *
 * `requireSandboxWallet` (convex/sandbox/auth.ts) proves ownership but does NOT bound how fast a
 * wallet may write, so the append-only / state mutations that guard on it alone (onboarding steps,
 * rewards save/claim) had no ceiling on write volume. The high-traffic execution
 * path (recordTransaction / recordSwap) already caps itself at MAX_TX_PER_HOUR, and umbrella /
 * liquidation carry their own hourly caps — this fills the gap for the rest.
 *
 * Backed by the shared @convex-dev/rate-limiter component (its own storage — no schema table), so the
 * counter is correct across Convex instances. The bucket is per identity KEY (wallet or Ask AI
 * subject), so wallets never contend on a shared row. The cap is deliberately generous: a legit flow
 * writes a handful of rows, so 300/min/identity never trips while still bounding a spray.
