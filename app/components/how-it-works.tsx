    title: "How Umbrella works",
    intro:
      "Umbrella is Avana's safety module for Aave v4-style markets. You stake coverage for a specific Hub reserve. If borrowing from that reserve leaves a deficit after liquidation, Umbrella coverage can absorb the residual loss, and you earn rewards for keeping capital available.",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Hub + reserve coverage",
        body: "Aave v4 separates liquidity (Hubs) from debt origination (Spokes). Umbrella coverage is scoped to a Hub + reserve and covers eligible deficits from every Spoke borrowing that reserve, including credit-line draws. Coverage committed to one Hub reserve cannot clear a deficit in another.",
      },
      {
        heading: "First-loss protection",
        body: "The Deficit Offset is the first-loss layer before Umbrella coverage. Avana absorbs losses up to that offset; only the residual shortfall beyond it can be covered by slashing staked coverage. This keeps protection proportional to the reserve's risk and economics.",
      },
      {
        heading: "How you earn",
        body: "Your APY combines the base supply yield and reward emissions for keeping capital available. Target coverage, reserve economics, opportunity cost, slashing risk, and lockup duration all inform the return needed to attract independent coverage capital.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Slashing stays live",
        body: "Your stake remains slashable while active and throughout cooldown. If a covered reserve records a deficit beyond its Deficit Offset, Umbrella capital is the protection layer exposed to that residual loss.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Cooldown & withdrawal window",
        body: "To unstake, first start a 20-day cooldown. During cooldown your position keeps earning and stays slashable. When cooldown ends, a 2-day withdrawal window opens — unstake within it, or restart cooldown before exiting.",
      },
    ],
    footnote:
      "Umbrella mirrors the Aave v4 coverage model. Coverage decisions consider loan size, collateral quality, borrower equity, liquidation capacity, reserve economics, and independent supplier depth. Only stake capital you're comfortable keeping deployed through market stress.",
  },
  lend: {
    title: "How Lending works",
    intro:
      "Supplying (lending) an asset earns you yield paid by borrowers. Your deposit joins a shared liquidity pool and starts earning immediately.",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "How you earn",
        body: "Borrowers pay interest on what they borrow, and that interest flows to suppliers. The supply APY moves with utilization — the more of the pool that's borrowed, the higher the rate.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Access to your funds",
        body: "You can withdraw supplied assets whenever there is available (un-borrowed) liquidity in the market. High utilization can temporarily limit how much you can pull out until borrowers repay.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Risks",
        body: "Lending carries smart-contract, oracle, and liquidity risk. Rates and available liquidity change with market demand — only supply amounts you're comfortable keeping deployed.",
      },
    ],
  },
  borrow: {
    title: "How Borrowing works",
    intro:
      "Borrowing lets you take a loan against collateral you deposit, without selling it. You keep exposure to your collateral while unlocking liquidity.",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Collateral & health factor",
        body: "Your borrowing power is a fraction of your collateral's value (its LTV). A health factor tracks how safe your position is — it falls when collateral drops in price or you borrow more.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Liquidation",
        body: "If your health factor falls too low, part of your collateral can be liquidated to repay the loan and restore safety. Keeping a buffer above the minimum protects you through volatility.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Interest & repayment",
        body: "Interest accrues on your debt at a variable rate. You can repay part or all of the loan at any time, and add or withdraw collateral to manage your health factor.",
      },
    ],
  },
  multiply: {
    title: "How Multiply works",
    intro:
      "Multiply builds a leveraged position in one step: it supplies your collateral, borrows against it, and re-supplies — looping to give you amplified exposure to the collateral asset.",
    sections: [
      {
        heading: "Leverage, in one action",
        body: "Instead of manually looping supply-and-borrow, Multiply sets your target leverage and opens the whole position at once. Higher leverage means larger exposure from the same equity.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Net APY",
        body: "Your return is the collateral's yield minus the cost of the borrowed leg, applied across the leveraged size. Leverage amplifies this both ways — if borrow cost exceeds yield, leverage works against you.",
      },
      {
        heading: "Liquidation risk",
        body: "A leveraged position has a tighter liquidation buffer: smaller price moves affect your health factor more. You can deleverage, add collateral, or close the position at any time.",
      },
    ],
  },
