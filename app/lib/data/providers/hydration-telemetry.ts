/**
 * Dev-only telemetry for silent per-field catalog fallbacks in market hydration.
 *
 * When `mergeConvex*Snapshots` receives a snapshot that omits an expected field
 * (name, symbol, maxLtvPct, reserveFactorPct, …), it silently keeps the catalog
 * value. That's the right degrade — the page still renders — but it turns the
 * snapshot's completeness into a stability question no one is looking at.
 *
 * This helper surfaces the incomplete snapshot as a one-time dev-console warn so
 * the seed / dailyStats writer gets fixed when a new field is added. Silent in
 * production and test — the tag `[live-hydration]` is grep-able for anyone reading
 * their local browser console.
