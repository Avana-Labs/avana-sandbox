/**
 * Deterministic token USD price fixture — the SINGLE seed/fallback for the canonical price store
 * (see canonical.ts). It exists so tests, local dev, SSR, and offline renders have stable,
 * deterministic prices; at runtime the live Convex oracle (convex/prices.ts, DefiLlama) overlays
 * these values and is the source of truth when connected.
 *
 * This is NOT a hand-maintained "production price" — it is a fixed snapshot. Previously these
 * numbers were duplicated across three hand-synced maps (sandbox-baseline-prices, the Convex
 * onboarding/umbrella copies); this module is the app-side single source. Keys are UPPERCASE
 * symbols. Do NOT add live-moving values here — real prices come from the oracle.
