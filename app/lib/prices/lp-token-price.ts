/**
 * Canonical Avana LP-collateral valuation: an LP token is worth the weighted sum of its
 * constituent token USD prices.
 *
 *   LPPriceUSD  = Σ (weightᵢ × TokenPriceUSDᵢ)      with  Σ weightᵢ = 1
 *   SuppliedUSD = SuppliedLPAmount × LPPriceUSD
 *
 * This is the SINGLE LP-collateral model for the app. It intentionally does NOT use the
 * constant-product "fair value" 2·√(P0·P1), nor any reserves / LP-total-supply derivation —
 * those were removed (see docs/token-pricing-architecture-audit.md). Weights are the
 * configured pool weights (equal-weight or explicitly weighted), supporting 2, 3, 4+ tokens.
 *
 * If ANY constituent has no valid price, the LP price is `unavailable` — we never emit a
 * number derived from incomplete data. Pricing here is float (a displayed/collateral USD
 * figure); on-chain position math stays in bigint fixed-point (see credit-engine/units.ts).
