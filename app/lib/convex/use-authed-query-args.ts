 * Wallet-scoped reads call requireSandboxWallet, which THROWS for an unauthenticated request,

 * happens whenever a wallet id is known before the JWT is attached: the local fallback session
 * while auth mints, a token refresh, or Playwright test mode against a real backend.
 * Pass `null` when the query shouldn't run for other reasons (e.g. no wallet yet).
