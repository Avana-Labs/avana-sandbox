/**
 * The Vercel Analytics / Speed Insights beacon (loaded at runtime in production)

 * offline tab, a strict corporate proxy — the SDK surfaces the rejection as an
 * uncaught "Analytics SDK: TypeError: Failed to fetch" console error. It is
 * entirely benign (telemetry is best-effort) but shows up as a page error.
 *
 * `isAnalyticsBeaconRejection` recognises exactly those rejections so the global
 * handler can swallow only them and let every other error propagate normally.
