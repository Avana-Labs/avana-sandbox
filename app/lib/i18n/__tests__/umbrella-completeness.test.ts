/**
 * Wave-4 A completeness test. Unlike the sibling translation-completeness suite
 * (which only checks keys already present in ≥1 locale), this one asserts that
 * a hand-curated set of umbrella-feature source strings is translated in EVERY
 * non-English locale. Fails on the "translator forgot the new page" class of
 * regression: adding a new umbrella t("…") without matching entries in the 13
 * dicts stays English-fallback in production, and this test surfaces it in CI.
 *
 * When adding an umbrella string, also add its English source to this list.
