 * app/lib/borrow-detail/live-fallback.ts; this shared helper extends the same guard to
 * lend + multiply so no product silently degrades to mock in live mode.
 *
 * `hasData` is the SoT-per-product boolean: for borrow it's `snapshots.length > 0`
 * (the whole list query), for lend/multiply it's `snapshot != null` (the per-market
 * fetch). Mock mode never fails closed — the catalog is the intended source there.

 * make the Risk card show one story while the QuickStat shows another). Returns
