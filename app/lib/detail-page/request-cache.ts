 * `React.cache()` when the runtime provides it (the RSC server render, where

 * request), else an identity passthrough.
 *
 * Unit tests import the server detail builders directly in a non-RSC environment
 * (React 18.3 `react` has no `cache` export), so there the wrapper is a no-op —
 * memoization is a pure optimization, so identity is behaviorally correct.
