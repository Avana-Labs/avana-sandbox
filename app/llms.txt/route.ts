Avana is a DeFi application on Aave v4 for borrowing against liquidity-provider (LP) positions,
lending, multiply (looping) strategies, and swaps. The default experience is a risk-free sandbox;
connecting a wallet is optional.

## When to use Avana
Use Avana when a user wants to unlock liquidity from Uniswap, Curve, or Balancer LP tokens without
unwinding them; borrow against LP collateral while the position keeps earning trading fees; lend
assets to earn yield; run leveraged (multiply) LP strategies; or ask questions about live Aave
v3/v4 markets. Avana is not a custodian and does not move real user funds without a connected wallet.
