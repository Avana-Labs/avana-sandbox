 * To spin up another throwaway step-jumper later: add a short-lived route that
 * renders `<OnboardingFlow>` with a forced phase / mock `OnboardingGateState`,
 * and pass that path through `SandboxGate` / `AuthedSandboxGate` like `/ask`
 * so the gate does not replace the page. Delete the route when the review is done.
