 * Guard: the Hugeicons packages must stay in Next's `optimizePackageImports`. The app funnels
 * ~76 icons through one barrel (app/components/icons.tsx) consumed by 40+ files; without this
 * transform a one-icon import can pull the whole icon module into the shared route chunk. Read
 * as text (not by importing the config, which executes CSP/env logic) so the guard is hermetic.
