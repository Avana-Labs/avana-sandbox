# Avana Webapp (Sandbox)

Interactive frontend for exploring **Avana** — borrow against LP positions on Aave v4. Everything runs locally with **synthetic wallets, markets, and transactions** so you can learn flows, stress-test UX, and validate engine behavior without mainnet risk.

## Main routes

| Route        | What to try                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`          | Home workspace — Borrow, Repay, Claim, Remove in one card |
| `/borrow`    | Market explorer + pool detail pages with sidebar actions  |
| `/lend`      | Supply / withdraw stable and volatile assets              |
| `/multiply`  | Loop markets, leverage ruler, deleverage                  |
| `/dashboard` | Portfolio tabs: Borrow, Lend, Multiply, Activity          |
| `/rewards`   | AVA quest rewards + product-linked claim flows            |

## Core flows to exercise

1. **Borrow** — Select collateral pool → enter amount → review health factor / borrowing power → simulate transaction.
2. **Pledge (supply collateral)** — Pick an LP pool you hold → deposit → see borrow power increase.
3. **Repay / Remove / Claim** — Pay down debt, withdraw collateral %, or claim fee rewards.
4. **Lend** — Deposit wallet balance into a market; withdraw supplied position.
5. **Multiply** — Set collateral amount + multiplier; review net APY, LTV, liquidation price.
6. **Rewards** — Complete quest-style tasks; claim AVA and product rewards.
